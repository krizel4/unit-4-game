## Unit 4 Game
This week for UCLA's coding bootcamp, we're exploring jQuery by creating a game called "Crystal's Collector". The object of the game is to click crystals until you match a specific, randomly generated number.

Click [here](https://krizel4.github.io/unit-4-game/) to play the game.

## How to Play

* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
* There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
* You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
* Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
